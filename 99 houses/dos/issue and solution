#### ‚úÖ ISSUE 1: Mismatched Area and Price per sq.ft.

**Problem:** Total price must always equal `Area √ó Price_per_sq.ft.` Changing the area type (e.g., from Carpet Area to Super Built-up Area) without adjusting the rate causes incorrect pricing.
there is an issue area_price_pre_sqft  when multiply with areawithtyle price is sanme but if we change carpet area and
buildup area to super buildup area and multiply with price_per_sqft Price change thats an issue

    We have:
        `area_price_pre_sqft` (price per sq. ft.)
        `areaWithType` (area + type) ‚Üí could be Carpet, Builtup, or Super Builtup
        `price in crore` (total price)

    When you multiply:
        area  price_per_sqft = total_price
        It only works correctly if the `area` and `price_per_sqft` use the same basis.

    The mismatch
        If the `price_per_sqft` is based on Carpet Area, multiplying it by Super Builtup Area will inflate the total
        price, Because Super Builtup is always larger than Carpet Area.Or vice versa: If your `price_per_sqft` is based
        on SBA, but you multiply it by Carpet Area, your total will look too low.

    Why this happens
        Builders often advertise lower per sq.ft. rates by quoting Super Builtup
        Actual `price_per_sqft` for Carpet is always higher, because the area is smaller.


So what‚Äôs the solution?

    RULE:
        If you adjust the area, you must also adjust the `price_per_sqft` to keep the total price the same.
        How to adjust `price_per_sqft`

    Use:
        Original Price = Area\Price per sq.ft.

        So if you change the area, the new `price_per_sqft` should be:
            New Price per sq.ft. = Original Price\New Area
            Example
                |                                             | Carpet Area | SBA | price per sq.ft. | Total Price |
                | Original                                    | 1000        | ‚Äî   | ‚Çπ5000            | ‚Çπ50,00,000  |
                | You convert Carpet ‚Üí SBA: 1000 / 0.7 = 1429 |             |     | ?                |             |

            You must adjust:
                New price per sq.ft. = 50,00,000\1429 = 3500
                So the total price stays the same.
    Now you can multiply:
         df['price_check'] = df['adjusted_area']  df['adjusted_price_per_sqft']
         It will match the original total price.

   key takeaway
        Never change just the area.
        Always adjust the `price_per_sqft` to keep total price consistent.
